## General
RenJS is based on Phaser.
RenJS helps us make "Visual Novel" (conversational dialogue) much easier.
It's exactly what I need for coming projects.
So I downloaded the code and examine it with some notes in `Notes.txt`.

## Description
+ The project is runable with a server (or you can go with Phaser Editor).
+ The project is a tutorial about itself, very interesting.
+ Writer can setup a conversation with YAML format (very easy to read and understand), with some conventions.
+ Anyone can replace or add more characters, items, backgrounds, musics, sounds to the project easily. Just need to edit `Setup.yaml`.
+ Programmer can add more particle effect, ambient effect or even complex actions to the game easily.
